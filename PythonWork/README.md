Created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. Used a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. Created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following: the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period,the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, the greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period. Script also prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
